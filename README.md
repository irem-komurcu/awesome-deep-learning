# Say Hi to Deep Learning

## Why Deep?
Deep Learning is a concept that has revolutionized the field of artificial intelligence and has gained popularity in recent years. Inspired by the working principles of the human brain, this approach uses multilayer artificial neural networks to solve complex problems and explore deep structures in data. So why is this approach called "deep," and why is it so important?

Deep Learning stands out with its ability to automatically learn high-level representations in data. This means it can represent data in a more meaningful way. Deep learning models analyze data layer by layer with operations in multi-layered neural networks and represent them at higher abstraction levels. In this way, important features in the data are automatically discovered.

## Machine Learning Umbrella and Deep Learning Relationship
Machine learning and deep learning are two important concepts that have significantly impacted the fields of artificial intelligence and data analytics. While they are related, they are also distinct. Machine learning is a broader term encompassing deep learning, a subset of machine learning. Understanding the differences between machine learning and deep learning is crucial.

### Machine Learning
Machine learning is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computer systems to improve by utilizing data. Its goal is to develop algorithms that can detect patterns and relationships to solve specific tasks or problems. Machine learning allows a model to learn from data-driven experiences and make predictions based on new data.

Machine learning includes various techniques such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.

- **Supervised Learning:** Labeled data is used to train the model in this approach. The model learns to associate input data with a specific output or class label. Examples of supervised learning tasks include handwriting recognition or email spam filtering.
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Unlabeled data is used in this approach. The model attempts to discover structures or hidden patterns in the data. Examples of unsupervised learning tasks include clustering based on similar features or dimensionality reduction.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** In this approach, an agent learns to achieve a specific goal by interacting with its environment. The model learns to make the correct decisions based on feedback received from the environment. Examples of reinforcement learning tasks include learning strategies for playing games or robot control.

Machine learning algorithms involve important stages such as feature engineering, model selection, and hyperparameter tuning. During these stages, thoroughly examining the dataset, preprocessing steps, and proper model training is necessary.

### Deep Learning
Deep learning is a **subset of machine learning** that utilizes artificial neural networks to solve complex problems. It focuses on **solving complex problems** using models consisting of multiple layers of neural networks. Deep learning models learn high-level representations from the data, automatically performing feature engineering.

Deep learning differs from traditional machine learning methods in several ways:

1. **Feature Learning:** In traditional machine learning methods, feature engineering is performed to manually extract features from the dataset. Deep learning, on the other hand, learns features automatically. This requires less human intervention and can discover more complex features.
2. **Data Representations:** Deep learning models learn high-level representations of the data through operations in multi-layered neural networks. These representations enable more meaningful data representation and enhance the model's performance.
3. **Computational Power:** Deep learning models often require larger computational resources to perform well on large datasets and complex problems. Therefore, deep learning typically demands more computational power.

Machine learning and deep learning are often confused because deep learning is a subset of machine learning. However, deep learning is a more specialized and complex field requiring more computational power and data. Additionally, deep learning is commonly applied in high-dimensional datasets and complex data types such as images, audio, or natural language processing tasks. In contrast, machine learning can be applied to a wider range of data types and tasks.

### Where is Data Science in this?

I wrote a Medium Blog about Data Science hierarchy. This blog contains Data Scienceâ€™s working areas.

[Data Science and Data Science Hierarchy](https://heartbeat.comet.ml/data-science-and-data-science-hierarchy-4e7a5b924184)

Data Science can be defined as a field where disciplines such as data analytics, statistics, machine learning, and data exploration are combined. Analyzing data, revealing exploratory information by modeling, and making data-based decisions are the main goals of Data Science. Deep Learning is an important component within this broad field.

Deep Learning plays an important role in Data Science. Data Science often resorts to deep learning methods to analyze complex structures in large data sets and obtain data-driven results. Deep Learning automatically learns high-level representations in data using models composed of multi-layered neural networks. This provides the ability to discover important features in data and model complex relationships.
